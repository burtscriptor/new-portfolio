            <p className="drop-cap">Employed as a registered nurse of a 
                number of years I enjoy
                assiting people, problem solving and working in teams. Inspired by
                the introduction of technology into nursing and wanting to follow
                 in my fathers footsteps as a programmer
            , I'm making a transition to software engineering.

            <p>
            I love knowing how things work and the creative process of building applications.
            </p>
            <p>I enjoy learning and playing music, 
                I've been an rock climber for a decade and enjoy the logistics and planning of big wall climbing.
                 I'm equally happy at home cooking up a storm in the kitchen</p>
