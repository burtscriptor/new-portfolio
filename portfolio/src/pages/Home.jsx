                        I love logic and creativity and using them to solve complex problems. 
                        Whether it's optimising front-end interfaces to create seamless user experiences, 
                        or structuring scalable APIs, I grow with the challenges of development. 
                        I thrive on crafting apps and collaborating with people. While others might catch up on 
                        the latest episode of "Nonsense" on Binge, I find my guilty pleasure in honing my coding skills and collorbating on music projects.
